# Building-your-own-Chatbot
Build Chatbot NLP in Python with Deep Learning
Simple Food Ordering Chatbot built with GloVe Word Embeddings

A lightweight NLP-based chatbot that understands food preferences and basic conversation using pre-trained word vectors. This project demonstrates intent classification with vector similarity in under 100 lines of code - no complex neural networks required.

## Features
* Intent recognition (greet, inform, affirm, deny)
* Cuisine identification using vector similarity
* Natural language understanding with pre-trained GloVe embeddings
* Simple yet effective centroid-based classification
* No complex neural networks or extensive training needed

## Technical Details
* Built using Python, Gensim, and NumPy
* Uses 300-dimensional GloVe word embeddings
* Vector-space similarity for intent classification
* Template-based natural-sounding responses
